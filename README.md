Hi, I'm <a href='https://andrewjhunt.github.io/'>Andrew Hunt</a>. These are some of my <a href='https://github.com/andrewjhunt'>github</a> projects focussed on home recording and music production. That's my hobby. By day, I work in software.

**[logic-pro-scripter](https://andrewjhunt.github.io/logic-pro-scripter/)**

> This guide is intended for developers who want to use their dev knowledge to do good stuff with Scripter for MIDI in Logic Pro. It assumes some knowledge of both Logic Pro and JavaScript. I maintain it because I found Apple’s Scripter documentation both incomplete and somewhat difficult to use.

**[equal-loudness](https://andrewjhunt.github.io/equal-loudness)**

> Use simple EQ to simulate the audio balance at a different loudness without changing your volume. Improve the bass-mid-high balance in your mixing and mastering while listening at a comfortable volume.  The project describes the psycho-acoustic basis for the EQ curves with software calculations.

**[speaker-loudness-calibration](https://andrewjhunt.github.io/speaker-loudness-calibration)**

> Home studio sound depends upon good audio and loudness is critical to the quality. We all like it louder but getting balanced sound is about calibration and control. This project provides the tools and steps to do a decent calibration of loudness from your computer speakers without expensive equipment.
