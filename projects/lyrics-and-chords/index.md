## Return JSON Object {#return-json-object}

Example JSON object:

{% raw %}

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "missing": [],
  "questions": [],
  "problems": [],
  "notes": ["format: chords-over-words"],
  "setAside": [],
  "song": {
    "type": "chordSheet",
    "lines": [
      { "type": "line", "items": [{ "type": "tag", "name": "title", "value": "Invented Song", "attributes": {} }] },
      { "type": "line", "items": [{ "type": "tag", "name": "start_of_verse", "value": "Verse 1", "attributes": {} }] },
      { "type": "line", "items": [
        { "type": "chordLyricsPair", "chords": "Am", "chord": null, "lyrics": "Some invented ", "annotation": "" },
        { "type": "chordLyricsPair", "chords": "C", "chord": null, "lyrics": "words here", "annotation": "" } ] },
      { "type": "line", "items": [{ "type": "tag", "name": "end_of_verse", "value": "", "attributes": {} }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

* `status` is `ok`, `needs-info` (loaded, but the title, the credits or the date is missing, and `questions` says what to ask) or `failed` (`problems` says why).
* `song` is [ChordSheetJS](https://github.com/martijnversluis/ChordSheetJS)'s JSON: song facts as tag lines, sections as `start_of_...` and `end_of_...` tags, and each lyric line as a list of chord-and-lyric pairs.
